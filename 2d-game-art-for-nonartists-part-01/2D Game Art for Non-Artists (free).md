# 2D Game Art for Non-Artists (free)
In this series, Steve Curtis is going to demonstrate how to harness the power of Photoshop to get beautiful 2D art work for games, even if you’ve never created art before. This is High-Rez art designed to look like modern graphics but with that old school feel. Although it isn’t pixel art, the graphics created could certainly be sized down to create art that has that pixel art feel. This course uses Photoshop, however GIMP and similar programs should suffice. No tablet is required, all of the art in this series was created using only a mouse. 

We will create beautiful cartoon art with a modern edge, and harness light and shading techniques to give our work depth.

### Intro
An introduction to the purpose of the course and the art we will create

### Sky and Mountains
In this video we will create the tiling sky panel and the mountains that we will use in the background and midground in a fashion that will allow for a parallax effect in Unity

### Making Happy Little Trees
We cover methods for creating beautiful curves for our trees, even with a mouse and no ability to make smooth curves ourselves.

### Earth Blocks
Using a number of procedures we create both non-tiling and tiling blocks of earth for creating the play area of our forest level.

### Awesome 2D Grass
In this video we create some spectacular grass transparencies. We will create grass to sit on top of our level blocks, and also some for decoration between other level assets.

### I Wanna Rock
Time to add some decorative rock to our level, we take a look at creating rock outcroppings from a single, simple to create rock created with… clouds?

### Creating our Buzz Saw
We’ll look at creating matching complex objects by creating our own custom brush and using color adjustment levels.

### Character
In this final video we’ll re-create the Talented Ball Character from our Max and Maya training series in 2D, and spruce him up to make a fun game character in Unity
