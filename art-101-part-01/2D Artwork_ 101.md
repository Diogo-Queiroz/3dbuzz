# 2D Artwork: 101
Perhaps you want to make games, create animations, or VFX for film. Perhaps you want to create concept art, or simply create for your own pleasure. Whether you're working with 2D or 3D art, it's important to have a grounding in the rules and basic techniques.

With that in mind, we asked Derek Stevens to create a series that anyone can follow. Our goal is to help you see the world, both inner and outer, by the rules of art. Over the course of the next two hours, Derek will demonstrate bringing your visions to life. From simple shapes to still life and perspective, all you have to do is follow the rules. And of course, remember how to get to Carnegie Hall. Practice, practice, practice!

### Intro to lines and shapes
In the first video, we will look at creating an iconic character through the use od simple shapes and lines. Anything you want to create starts with this simple, but often overlooked, concept. Challenge yourself to see the world the artist's way.

### Learning hand control
We pick up from the first video looking at methods for creating lines. Even more importantly, we will look at ways of increasing hand control, and building the hand-eye coordination to realize your vision.

### Creating volume through shading
 Bring a flat picture to life means one thing, shedding light on your subject. Derek illuminates this subject by demonstrating how to create shadow through basic shading techniques such as Hatching and Cross-Hatching. He also discusses the direction of light and how that affects your work.

### Gestures
To the uninitiated, it looks like scribbling. To an artist, it's a tried and true method for blocking out your subject. Welcome to creating with Gestures! Derek demonstrates how to take the hand control you've been practicing and build the basic form of your subject, creating your composition correctly from the start.

### Reaffirming the lines
Time to put what we've learned to work! In this lesson, we look into the creation of a simple still life drawing. Everything we've learned so far will come into play as we create a picture of everyday objects brimming with smooth lines, simple shapes, light, and shadow.

### Perspective
The rules of perspective can add depth to your work above even light and shadow. In this final lesson, we will look at the various types of perspective and their application. One point, Two point, and Three point perspective, Derek gives you the tools to understanding why each type works, and how you can apply them.
