# 3Ds Max - Legacy Video Training
The Legacy Series is an archive of older videos created as free content from throughout the history of 3D Buzz. Most of these videos are a bit dated in terms of the version of the software used, but the content within them may still be very useful to some. These videos have been provided here as a way for you access some of 3D Buzz's earlier content, though it is also helpful to those who have opted out of updating to the most recent version of a particular software package.

## Polygonal Modeling Tools
Polygonal Modeling Tools

### 01 - Intro to Modeling
This video servers as an introduction to the series, in which we will be discussing polygonal modeling in 3ds Max 5.

### 02 - PolyMesh
In this video we discuss converting your model into an editable polygon object.

### 03 - Selection Rollout
One of the first requirements of modeling a polygonal object is to be able to select it's subobjects. Here, we cover this via the Selection Rollout.

### 04 - Soft Selections
Here we discuss soft selections, which allow for manupulation of polygonal subobjects using adjustable falloff.

### 05 - Edit Geometry Rollout
The Edit Geometry rollout contains a variety of different modeling operations which are discussed in this video.

### 06 - Subdivision Surfaces
Subdivision surfaces are used to help smooth out a model and here we look at how this is done through the Subdivision rollout.

### 07 - Edit Vertices 
Vertices are the most fundamental of the polygonal subobjects. In this video, we look at the vertex-specific modeling operations.

### 08 - Edit Edges
Several of the modeling operations are geared specificall for edges. These are explored in this video.

### 09 - Edit Borders
Here we take a look at the Edit Borders rollout and the border-specific modeling operations.

### 10 - Edit Polygons
In this video we examine the Edit Polygons rollout and the tools and operations found within.

### 11 - Simple Wristwatch
With a basic understanding of the primary modeling tools, we now create a basic wristwatch model.

## Poly Modeling - Alien Head
Poly Modeling - Alien Head

### 01 - Intro to the Alien Head
This introductory video covers what we'll be discussing as we model out the alien head in 3ds Max 5

### 02 - Image Planes
The first step in creating our alien head model is to properly position our image planes for reference.

### 03 - Roughing In
With our image planes in place, we can now move on to the modeling process. Here, we rough in the head shape.

### 04 - The Eye
We now add the basic geometry needed for the alien's eye and get it placed accordingly.

### 05 - The Mouth
Our alien needs a mouth. In this video, we add and adjust the necessary edges to give him one.

### 06 - Tweaking
With our alien head nearly finished, we now move on to some tweaks and adjustments of the model.

### 07 - Seams
Our last step in modeling the head of the alien is to clean up the seams along his centerline. 

## Poly Modeling - Alien Body
Poly Modeling - Alien Body

### 01 - Intro to the Alien Body
In this video we introduce the topics that will be covered as we model out the aliens body in 3ds Max 5.

### 02 - Roughing In
Our first step in modeling out the alien body is to get a rough torso into place so that we can add details later.

### 03 - Detailing Chest & Ribs
We now begin the detailing process for the alien's pectoral muscles, as well as his prominent ribs

### 04 - Detailing Stomach & Back
With the chest out of the way, we add in some detail for the alien's stomach and back.

### 05 - Hips & Legs
We now move on to the alien's hips and legs, stopping at the ankles, as we will be doing the feet later.

### 06 - Shoulder& Arms
Using extrusions, we now create the arms for the alien, detailing in a bit of muculature and bone structure.

### 07 - Hands
Our next step is to add in the hands for the alien at the end of the wrists, including 3 fingers and a thumb.

### 08 - Feet
The final piece of the alien's body is the feet and in this video we create those with some modified extrusions.

### 09 - Attaching the Head
The only thing left to finalize the alien character is to attach the head created in the previous issue to the new body.

## Human IK - Introduction
Human IK - Introduction

### 01 - Introduction
This video introduces the series, in which we will discuss the HumanIK plugin for 3ds Max 5.

### 02 - HumanIK Body Generator
Here we discuss the BodyGenerator within the HumanIK plugin, which creates a skeletal system to place inside your character.

### 03 - Fitting the Body
Here we take a look at how to take a HumanIK BodyGenerator skeleton and place it inside of a 3D model.

### 04 - Intro to HumanIK
In this video we introduce you to actually applying HumanIK to the BodyGenerator skeleton. 

### 05 - Custom Skeleton 
Here we look at how we can take a custom skeleton not created with BodyGenerator and apply HumanIK to it.

### 06 - Poses
In this lesson we look at working with poses inside HumanIK, including loading, saving, and cut/copy/paste poses as well.

### 07 - Keyframing
We now move on to keyframing the HumanIK control rig, showing some of the things you must keep in mind when animating the rig.

### 08 - Retargeting
In this video we take a look at retargeting a HumanIK rig, allowing us to reuse animation or to even utilize motion capture data.
